# **Git Introduction**

## *Git it's a Version Control System*

It's the same as [GitHub](github.com) but it's locally, so you can clone your repositories from Github to get and make whatever you want.


### Cloning can be done with few steps:

1. Open GitHub
2. Visit your GitHub profile and create a repository
3. Then click on the code button
4. Copy the link

 Edits can be done by using Terminal or VS code, for this stage we used [replit](replit.com) throughout shell , Also we can use commands to help us while editing like:

- $ cd : is To change direction.
- $ mkdir : Make directory {Create new Folder}
- $ touch : Create new file 

You can find the rest of the commands throughout this [link](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/) 

Then when you're done you want to push your work back to your GitHub account 

Pushing can be done with few commands written in shell:

 1. $ git add .

 2. $ git commit -m ""

 3. $ git push origin main
