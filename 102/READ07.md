# **Control Flow**

## *Control flow: is an order which the computer EXCUTES statements in a script.*

- When we press on RUN the  code will directly run from first line until last line.

   UNLESS :
- The computer runs across the structure; this will result in changing the control flow
Example: 

1. Conditionals

2. Loops
