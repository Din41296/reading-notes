# **What google learned from its quest build the perfect team**



* This article was talking about a woman called Julia Rozovsky.
* Julia was trying to find a job thatn matches her requirements, she worked before in jobs like:
   1. In consulting firm
   2. Researcher for two professors at Harvard.

* She didn't like the second job even it was interesting but she felt lonely.
  

* In 2009, she was accepted in bussiness schools by the Yale School of Management, in this school Julia was searching about teammates that she could work with, she failed in the first group, because she always felt that she is scared from doing mistakes and her teammates judge her.

* She finally found the teammates that was exactly looking for:
     1. Innovate faster
     2. Ses mistakes more quickly 
     3. Find better solutions for problems
   

* At the end I would like to say that there is always either bad teams or successful teams.
